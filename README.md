# Top Down Shooter

This is a small browser-based shooter game built with JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No additional dependencies are required.

## Controls

- Move with **WASD** or the arrow keys.
- Aim with the mouse.
- Hold the left mouse button to shoot.
- Press **R** to reload when out of ammo.
- The magazine holds 12 bullets.

## Gameplay

Enemies spawn from the edges of the screen and chase the player. Randomly generated obstacles appear on each run and block movement and bullets.
The player now has 3 health points. Colliding with an enemy removes one point; losing all health ends the game.
When the game ends, click anywhere on the canvas to restart.

The game includes basic sound effects, particle explosions and screen shake for
a juicier experience. Enemies take multiple hits before dying, making gunfights
more engaging.
